# Drools-DSL-Plugin

This project expands on the existing Drools plugin for the IntelliJ IDE.

The current plugin contains support mainly for .drl files, but not enough for .dsl and .dslr files. Using this plugin in
the IDE will add syntax highlighting and error checking for those files in open editors.
